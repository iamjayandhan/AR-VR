# AR-VR
AR stands for Augmented Reality, while VR stands for Virtual Reality. Both of these technologies offer immersive experiences, but they differ in their approach. In Augmented Reality, virtual objects are overlaid onto the real world. This can be done through the camera of a mobile device or specialized glasses, such as Microsoft HoloLens.
